Fantasy Tale
The whisper of the ancient forest enveloped Mira as she crept between the moss-covered oaks. It was her first time venturing this far into the Enchanted Woods, but she had no choice. Only here grew the silver ferns whose pollen could save her ailing grandmother.
Suddenly, the silence was broken by the snap of a twig. Mira froze. From between the trees emerged a figure with luminous blue skin. A forest elf! Creatures known for their dislike of humans.
"A human in our forest?" the elf's voice sounded like the murmur of a stream. "What brings you here, mortal?"
"My grandmother is dying," Mira whispered. "I need the silver ferns."
The elf narrowed his eyes, which reflected stars despite the daylight.
"Silver ferns do not grow for humans. But..." he hesitated. "I have heard of your grandmother. She was the one who saved an injured elven prince during the Great Tempest."
Mira's eyes widened. Grandmother had never mentioned elves!
"I will guide you," the elf decided. "I am Finael."
They followed a winding path, visible only to elven eyes. The forest around them pulsed with magic. Fireflies danced in the air, and trees whispered ancient stories.
In a small clearing grew ferns shimmering with silver light. Finael gently picked a few leaves.
"Brew a potion at midnight, when the moon is full," he instructed.
"Thank you," Mira accepted the gift with gratitude.
"Tell your grandmother that the Forest People's debt has been repaid," the elf smiled. "And you, Mira, are now a friend of the elves. You may return whenever you wish."
As the girl returned to her village, she felt she had discovered a secret that would change her life forever. Magic truly existed, and she had just become part of its world.
